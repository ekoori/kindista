# About Kindista

### What is Kindista?

Kindista is a _social generosity network_ founded on the belief that
**sharing is good**.
Kindista helps you to connect with people who live near you so
that you can share with each other and let other people know how much
you appreciate them.

### What is Kindista's mission?

Kindista's mission is the same as that of it's parent organization, CommonGoods Network:

_We foster networks of trust and facilitate the sharing of knowledge, abilities, and physical resources to transform communities and engender a sustainable and harmonious world._

### How does Kindista make money?

Kindista is funded entirely through donations to its parent organization,
CommonGoods Network. If you would like to support Kindista, please
[make a tax-deductable donation](/donate) to CommonGoods.

This is only possible because [Benjamin](/people/benjamin) and
[Eamon](/people/root) have collectively volunteered over 2,000 hours to
the development of Kindista.

### What is CommonGoods Network?

CommonGoods Network is an Oregon 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization
founded in 2008 by [Benjamin](/people/benjamin).

To date, all of our funding has come from individual contributions and small grants, with initial funding contributed by Benjamin.

As a non-profit organization, Kindista cannot "sell out" or become a
publicly-traded corporation. As long we are able to sustain the
organization, CommonGoods will continue to serve its mission.

### Will Kindista ever sell advertising?

No. We believe that putting advertising on Kindista would dilute our
mission and compromise our integrity.
